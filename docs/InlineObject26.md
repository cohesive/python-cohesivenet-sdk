**ipsec_local_address** | **str** | This is effectively a \&quot;cloud NAT\&quot; address, since you don&#39;t know what your LAN address  will be between invocations in a cloud, this address can be used by remote endpoints  as your \&quot;behind a NAT\&quot; address, sometimes referred to Peer or IKE ID, if needed (e.g. Watchguard or Juniper). It can ALSO be thought of even more simply as an IPsec \&quot;loopback\&quot; interface that you can use to terminate traffic.  |
